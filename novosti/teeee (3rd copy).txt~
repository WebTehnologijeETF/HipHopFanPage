Eternal E: Eazy E, 20 Years Later
slike/EazyE.jpg
It was 20 years ago this week that Eazy E cruised to that great safehouse in the sky. I’ll never forget first hearing the news that he had AIDS and was dying in Cedars-Sinai. The radio station, 92.3 The Beat, kept public vigil. Dre and Cube and Bone Thugs reportedly filed
in to pay last respects to the legend. The hospital was only about a mile from where I had Little League practice and a group of us debated wandering over before quickly realizing that we weren’t exactly wanted.
