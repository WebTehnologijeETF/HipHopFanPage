Survival Of The Fittest (ESPN Remix)

A few days back, we reported that Mobb Deep would be remixing their 1995 cut "Survival Of The Fittest" to serve as the intro to ESPNz's "NBA Countdown" during the Western Conference Playoffs. Today, it's arrived.
Largely a vocal rework, the only true "remixing" done here is adding some high-octane keyboards to the mix, with the original's low-key menacing piano shuffle otherwise staying intact.
